## Problem Statement

[cite_start]The major goal of this project is to improve the delivery of citizen services in the village by computerizing applications for gram panchayat services. [cite_start]Gram panchayat is a decentralized institution that manages applications and provides information about gram panchayat services. [cite_start]The suggested system will allow users to submit applications for various services and track their progress. [cite_start]The suggested system E-Services for Gram Panchayath develops a web application with the goal of providing government information about services or schemes, and public users can apply for services using an online application. [cite_start]Admin and staff will manage the application for approval and creation of the scheme.

## Setup and Local Execution

### Prerequisites

* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
* A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
* (Optional but Recommended) A local web server to avoid CORS issues (e.g., Live Server extension for VS Code, or Python's `http.server`).

### Firebase Project Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**:
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Click "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a new project.
2.  **Add a Web App**:
    * Inside your Firebase project, click on the "</>" icon to add a web app.
    * Follow the setup steps and **copy your Firebase configuration object**. This will look something like:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
         apiKey: "AIzaSyASuwzHzN7tF2CRWhikxclhHvyMr2pqCV4",
         authDomain: "digital-e-gram-panchayat-6fd24.firebaseapp.com",
         projectId: "digital-e-gram-panchayat-6fd24",
         storageBucket: "digital-e-gram-panchayat-6fd24.firebasestorage.app",
         messagingSenderId: "629896439749",
         appId: "1:629896439749:web:6377d8bf4de3eaf5794dac",
         measurementId: "G-XV8HB6P402"
          };
        ```
3.  **Update `js/script.js`**:
    * Open `js/script.js` in your project.
    * Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` with the actual configuration you copied from Firebase.
4.  **Enable Firebase Services**:
    * In your Firebase Console, navigate to:
        * **Authentication**: Go to "Build" > "Authentication" > "Get started". Then, go to the "Sign-in method" tab and enable "Email/Password".
        * **Firestore Database**: Go to "Build" > "Firestore Database" > "Create database". Start in "production mode" (you'll set up rules later) and choose a location.

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository (if not already done)**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/digital-e-gram-panchayat.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/digital-e-gram-panchayat.git)
    cd digital-e-gram-panchayat
    ```
2.  **Install Firebase SDK**:
    The Firebase SDK is included via CDN links in `index.html`, `login.html`, etc., so no separate installation is required for client-side use.

3.  **Serve the Files**:
    * **Using VS Code Live Server**: If you have Visual Studio Code, install the "Live Server" extension. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    * **Using Python's HTTP Server**: Open your terminal in the `digital-e-gram-panchayat` directory and run:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Firebase Firestore Rules (Example - **Crucial for Security**)

You MUST configure your Firestore security rules to protect your data. Here's a *basic* example to get started, but you will need to customize this heavily based on your role-based access control.
